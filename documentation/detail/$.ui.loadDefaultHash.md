$.ui.loadDefaultHash is a boolean value you set before $.ui.launch happens.  This tells the browser to load the first panel off the hash/URL being loaded.

```js
$.ui.loadHash=true;
$.ui.launch();
```

Look at the URL above, you should see the hash "#$.ui.loadDefaultHash" .  That is the ID for this panel.  If you reload the page, you will be taken back here, instead of the main panel.

<a href="javascript:document.location.reload()" class="button">Reload the page</a>
